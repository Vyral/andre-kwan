*As your mortgage lender, I’ll need to gather some documentation from you to get you the best possible loan and interest rate. Here’s a list of the things that I’ll need.*

The home-buying journey should be simple and easy, and it’s my job to help you get prepared by providing you the tools and education to make the process smoother.

When we meet face to face, make sure you come prepared with your documentation so that I can do my part in providing you with all the different loan options you may be eligible for as a buyer. **Here is a list of the documentation you should bring:**

**1\. Your two most recent Federal Tax Returns,** including your W-2s, or your K-1s if you’re self-employed.

**2\. Your two most recent pay stubs.**

**3\. Your assets.** This includes all documentation relating to your savings accounts, checking accounts, 401(k), and other retirement account information.

**4\. Your driver’s license, passport, and any other official ID.**

My job is to provide you with all the tools you need to map out a proper gameplan to help you succeed in your home purchase. **You’ll end up feeling super confident so that you can start shopping and submitting offers with your real estate agent.**

If you have any questions for me in the meantime, don’t hesitate to give me a call or send me an email. I look forward to hearing from you soon.

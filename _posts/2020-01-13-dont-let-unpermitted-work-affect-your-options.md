<p style="text-align: center;"><em>Have you done something unpermitted to your property, like adding a certain unit? Today’s message is for you.</em></p>

As we begin 2020, it’s important for you as a consumer to be aware of all the opportunities out there for you now. There’s a variety of products we offer at PrimeLending, but there is one product in particular in which many people aren’t aware. I’m excited to share it with you today.&nbsp;

Sometimes, a property will have a certain unit installed in it (or contract work done to it) that is unpermitted by the county. After anything unpermitted is done, the owners will find it difficult to refinance.&nbsp;

For example, if you have a single-family residence, but you built a unit in the back, you’ve likely done something unpermitted that can affect your refinancing options. Most banks will tell you, “We’re not going to touch this.”&nbsp;

However, **PrimeLending offers an appraisal that takes into consideration only the *permitted* items on a lot.** We will be able to do the loan without counting that unpermitted unit as part of the value.&nbsp;

If you find yourself in a situation like this and would like to know details on it, feel free to give us a call at PrimeLending. We’re experts on these kinds of financing options and we’d be glad to help you.

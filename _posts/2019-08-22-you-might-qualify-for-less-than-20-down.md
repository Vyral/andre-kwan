A popular myth that circulates among buyers today is that you’ll need to put at least 20% down to qualify for a home purchase. If that were the case, a lot of buyers out there would have no shot at getting into a home and would end up living in a van down by the river. The reality is that mortgages don’t have blanket requirements. There are so many loan programs available that depend on your budget, credit score, where you want to live, etc. In fact, some programs require as little as 3%, and others are zero-down\! &nbsp;Down payment assistance programs also exist for certain buyers. Our role is to set you up with the best possible mortgage on a home you truly love, and we’ll move mountains to make that happen for you.

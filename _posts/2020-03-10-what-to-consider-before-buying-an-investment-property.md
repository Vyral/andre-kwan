If you’re thinking of buying an investment property in 2020, moving forward with the purchase mostly depends on your long-term objectives.&nbsp;

If you’re able, Michael Radi, our branch manager, always recommends buying a two-, three-, or even four-unit property. One of the most important factors to consider in San Diego County is home prices.&nbsp;

If you want to buy a multi-unit property, you’ll have to put more money down based on the loan program you use. There are also restrictions to contend with in terms of the size of your loan. Reserve requirements are another factor to consider with these properties—you need several months’ worth of payments in reserve to qualify.&nbsp;

One of the primary reasons buying a multi-unit property is a great investment is because **you have multiple renters helping to pay down your mortgage.** If you’re a first-time buyer, this will allow you to buy a larger property as a future investment nest egg. Technically, you only have to live in the home a year before you're free to buy another investment property or long-term primary residence.&nbsp;

Before you do anything, though, consult with an experienced loan officer so they can outline all available opportunities.&nbsp;

If you have questions about this or any other lending topic or would like to schedule a consultation, don’t hesitate to reach out to me. I’d love to help you.

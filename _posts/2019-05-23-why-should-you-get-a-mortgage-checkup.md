What is a mortgage checkup? Why should you do one annually?

**A mortgage checkup is something we lenders like to do on an annual basis with our clients to see that they have a plan for their largest liability.**

Oftentimes, clients come to us wondering whether they have the best mortgage product or what their options are, and we usually have **three pieces of advice for them:**

1\. Look at your current mortgage statement and see how it compares to the market

2\. See if you have any equity or the ability to access equity

3\. Determine what your mortgage product looks like compared to other mortgage products

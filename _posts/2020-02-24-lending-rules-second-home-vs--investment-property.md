<p style="text-align: center;"><em>How will you be using that additional home you’re buying? Here’s why underwriters want to know the answer.</em></p>

Today we’re exploring the difference between buying a second home and buying an investment property. Typically, there are different rules at play for each scenario.&nbsp;

One clear example is the down payment: **You can buy a second home with as little as 10% down.** However, underwriters use a set of guidelines to make sure that your property will be used as a residence and not as an investment.&nbsp;

They’ll ask you questions to confirm you’re not going to rent out the property. They’ll even go so far as to double-check your tax returns to make sure that’s the case.&nbsp;

They’ll also want to know why you’re buying a second home. Perhaps you’re buying in a resort community, or your job demands that you work in a certain area for a certain amount of time each year. Is the home at least 100 miles away from your primary residence? Have you been a landlord in the past? These are all common questions.

Underwriters get particular because, **when you buy an investment property, they ask for a minimum of 15% down** (some increase it to 20% down because not all mortgage insurance companies will cover that purchase when you also buy an investment property).&nbsp;

What is the condition of the home? How much are the rents going for in that area? If it is currently rented, typically **most mortgage companies let you use 75% of the rental income to help offset that mortgage.** For instance, if that home is rented for $1,000, most mortgage companies will let you use $750 to apply to offset the mortgage on that particular home.&nbsp;

Second homes generally have a better interest rate than investment properties, but it is a case-by-case system; reach out to a seasoned mortgage professional for the proper guidance in helping you determine what makes the most sense.&nbsp;

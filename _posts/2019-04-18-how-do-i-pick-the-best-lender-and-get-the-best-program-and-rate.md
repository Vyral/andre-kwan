**We’re asked all the time by clients, agents, and referral partners, “Why are your guys the best lenders, and how do we get the best rates and programs possible?”&nbsp;**

Each individual case is different, but we truly want you to get some knowledge out of this so we’re going to let you know exactly how to go about finding the answer to this question yourself.

**I’d always start off by getting a written loan estimate.** This allows you to compare apples to apples across individual lenders.&nbsp;

**Secondly, I would also ask your referral partner or Realtor for recommendations.** There’s typically a big difference between the different lenders out there because of their experience level, who they may know on the listing agent’s side, and the process through which they go about closing your loan.

**Lastly, you should try to find some recommendations online.** You’ll see a really great marketplace for local and national lenders that you can also use to figure out why they’re good from the consumers who have used them.

If you have any questions for us in the meantime, don’t hesitate to give us a call or send us an email. We look forward to hearing from you soon.

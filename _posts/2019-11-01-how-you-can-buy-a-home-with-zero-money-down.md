*Don’t assume you can’t afford to buy a home. You can, and here’s how.*

If you’d like to buy a home but are worried you can’t afford it, I have good news: There are a few ways you can buy a home with 100% financing.&nbsp;

The first is by **using a VA loan**, which is reserved for veterans and active-duty members of the Armed Forces.

The second way you can purchase with 100% financing is by using PrimeLending's&nbsp;**Wealth Builder Program**.&nbsp; This is an adjustable rate mortgage product with a 20 or 15 year term - not a fixed product, which will help you reduce the principal on your loan fairly quickly (aka building wealth via equity). Keep in mind that some restrictions apply for this loan, and these restrictions pertain to what state you but in, your occupancy type, and your credit score and income.&nbsp;

If neither of these options fit for you or you can afford to put a little money down, you can take advantage of **conventional financing programs**, which allow a 97% loan-to-value rate on a 30-year fixed loan. Some FHA loan products allow up a 96.5% loan-to-value rate as well.

If you’re curious whether any of these loans are right for you or you have any other real estate questions, don’t hesitate to reach out to me. I’d love to help you.

Today’s message is centered around **the Bank Statement program** and how having one can work to your advantage if you’re self-employed. &nbsp;

A lot of self-employed, would-be homebuyers are left with very few options when trying to qualify for a mortgage, which is most often attributable to the numerous tax-off writeoffs they enjoy.&nbsp;

The Bank Statement program serves as a solution for these buyers because it gives them the power to use their bank statements dating back to the last 12 or 24 months in order to provide the bank with a record of all the deposits they’ve made in that time.&nbsp;

Then, we’ll take the sum total of those deposits from that 12- or 24-month period and find the average. If the bulk of those deposits have gone into your personal account, we’re able to use 100% of them for financing. If they’ve mostly gone into your business account, we’ll use about 50%. &nbsp;&nbsp;

Why is this important for you to know? **The Bank Statement program can be used as a vehicle for refinancing your home or finding out how much you qualify for in a purchase without any delay.&nbsp;**

This is a great product that provides relief to self-employed buyers who aren’t having much luck getting qualified for a home loan through other channels.&nbsp;

We’d be more than happy to go over your bank deposits over the last 12 or 24 months and to help you figure out the best, quickest way you can qualify. Please reach out to me with any questions you may have now or down the road. I look forward to hearing from you\!
